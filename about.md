Although Andrew appears serious and wise on the outside, inside his head is a younger version of himself looking for opportunities to play.

Can be quite stubborn. But only on things that matter. 

Ex-rugby player, one-time bungee jumper and two-time marathon runner. Now with a mild disregard for heights.

He believes that most things are achievable if you focus and put in enough effort. 

He gets joy from creating things, laughing, words appropriately combined, and helping others to learn and grow. He also loves building useful things.
