# Notes from Blockchain Summit London

After Angelhack at the weekend I decided to spend more time understanding Blockchain, and coincidentally it's Blockchain Summit London this week. 

These are my notes, focusing on potential uses and some of the challenges.

The first talk I attended was an enjoyable session from [Valeriy](https://twitter.com/vdlife) and Tatiana from [MyWish](https://twitter.com/mywishplatform) which is a platform for creating smart contracts without programming skills. 

Tatiana took us through the different smart contract options:

### Ethereum
* Popularity and openness
* Overloaded
* Complexity in decisions
* [Bugs](https://cointelegraph.com/news/parity-multisig-wallet-hacked-or-how-come) in smart contracts

### Bitcoin and RSK
* Bitcoin only simple smart contracts
* RSK: Ethereum virtual machine + own cryptocurrency SBTC
* 2 blockchains locking and releasing
* Cons: confusing with addresses, distrust

### NEO
* Already in production
* High speed
* Two currency (NEO & GAS)
* Huge contract price but free contract call

### EOS
* Delegated Proof of Stake
* C++ smart contract language
* [Ricardian contracts](http://iang.org/papers/ricardian_contract.html)

Tatiana gave the following smart contract applications:

* Insurance ([flights](https://etherisc.com/#products))
* Delivery ([pizza](http://bitcoinist.com/uk-papa-johns-accepts-bitcoin-potentially-expensive-pizza-experience/))
* Crowdsale
* Last will
* Marriage contract / family budget

Valeriy talked about a couple of possible contract applications:

* The lostkey contract transfers your wallet contents to a backup wallet when it hasn't been used for some time
* Multi-signature wallets allow release of funds only with signatures from multiple parties
* Delayed payment contracts can protect the wallet owner from being made to transfer funds when under threat

MyWish offer various Blockchain-related development services including Blockchain and Ethereum development, smart contract development and web/native mobile development.

**Jim Mclean of IBM talked about how blockchain will fundamentally disrupt the way we do business.**

Wealth is generated by the flow of goods and services across business network in transactions and contracts. Think about how you control change of property. In some cases (e.g. property) this involves a trusted third party, and it costs £££.

Also think about your digital assets. there is no secondary market for that digital market. Jim's children are back buying vinyl. There is a secondary market for vinyl. Think about your digital identity. Medical information. Who are you going to authorise to see what, where and when?

Cash is an asset, but has the challenge of anonymity. Try to go and buy and large value item, e.g. a car, for cash. It’s practically impossible. The dealership can’t take cash. They have to know [AML](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-launches-new-anti-money-laundering-watchdog) and [KYC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer).

IBM is [working with](https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/uk-en/hyperledger/) the Hyperledger Fabric project. 

The [Food Trust](https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions/food-trust/technology) programme allows buyers to determine which food from which farm from which shop, is contaminated. In 5 minutes, not 10 days.
