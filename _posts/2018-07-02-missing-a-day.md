title:  "Missing a Day"
---

If you've read my [earlier post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2018-06-15-what-changes-when-you-commit-to-writing-every-day.md %}) on writing every day, you may have noticed that I didn't post anything yesterday. Part of what I'm doing here is thinking about process, observing how I work, and then sharing that. 

I didn't post anything when I attended the [hackathon]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2018-06-25-angelhack-day-1.md %}) either. That was a full-on weekend.

_What happened yesterday?_

Whether I post daily, and what I post, shines a light on my ability to produce something meaningful on that day, and also highlights what else is going on. Yesterday my energy was lower than usual in the morning and I deviated from the usual routine (getting up an hour earlier than I used to, and reading, or journaling). On Monday it was busy at work ... moving desks, lots of noise. I stayed in the evening for longer than I needed to because I didn't feel that my day had been productive. The colleague on my current project comes in later and works later.

So I worked for an hour and a half longer than I needed to at the day job. I started a blog post on the train and then got home. Had a call about the next phase of our hackathon project, something to eat and spent time with the family. By that time it was late.

I can see those extra one or two hours in the day are important, and that I need to manage that time to keep shipping something every day. ~~If~~ When I do that daily it will accumulate.

When it comes to writing, I need to create a [shitty first draft](https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/11/22/bird-by-bird-anne-lamott/) earlier in the day to give my subconscious time to improve it; and to be deliberate about how I'm spending my time during the day, how to [start it](https://www.miraclemorning.com/), and take into account [energy levels](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/08/when-the-scientific-secrets-perfect-timing-daniel-pink-review) during the day.
