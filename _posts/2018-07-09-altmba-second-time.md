title:  "altMBA, Second Time Around"
---

Tomorrow I start the [altMBA](https://altmba.com/) for the second time, in an alumni cohort. This is altMBA22; when I took part last year it was altMBA9. This is the first time the programme has been offered to alumni, and I'm looking forward to seeing what's different in the programme, and in my perspective.

Our cohort is spread across a wide range of timezones from California to Singpore, and the sessions will be based on Eastern Standard Time (BST-5). 

As more of my time and energy is going to be focused on the altMBA, my writing will be reflecting that for the next four weeks.
