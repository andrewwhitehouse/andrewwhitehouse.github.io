title:  "How Can You Find Out?"
---
Last January I took part in the [altMBA](https://altmba.com/) programme which is for high-performing individuals who want to level up and lead. It expected it to be a compressed business course but it was much more than that.

One of the things I learned was the power of asking good questions.

This one is a gift that was shared by [Emily](https://twitter.com/EmilyWBT), one of our coaches, and I want to pass it on to you.

I was discussing something about an assignment I was stuck on and Emily asked me a question, to which I replied "I don't know". 

Her reply was "How can you find out?".

That threw me initially. And then I started to think about ways I could reduce that uncertainty: Could I try an experiment? Or ask someone who might know more?

You may not get an answer saying "do this". But you will be closer to the point where you've satisfied yourself that it's time to use your best judgement and act.

It's a really useful way to help us become unstuck. Framing a situation with the right question often provides focus on what to do next.

The next time a friend or colleague or family member says "I don't know" give them a generous nudge and ask "How can you find out?".
