# What Is It For?

Welcome! Thanks for taking the time to read this. 

I've started my first post with a question because I've learned that it's really important to be able to ask good questions. I'll be writing more about in future posts.

Whenever we commit time to something it's helpful to ask "What is this blog for?". What am I, what are we, looking to accomplish with this? And who is it for?

This blog is for me to share some of the things I've learned, with you. The different hats I wear are software developer, parent, football coach, reader and perpetual student. I'm an INFJ personality type, which means I'm really interested in people. The thread that brings my work together is technology, empathy and mental health.

Who is it for? It's for me, to practise writing, and to find people who may feel compelled to contact me because of something I'm written.

My intention is to show up regularly, with generosity, and share my thoughts and perspectives.

I hope you'll come with me on this journey.
