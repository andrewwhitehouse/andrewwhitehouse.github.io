Welcome! Thanks for taking the time to read this. 

I've started my first post with a question because I've learned recently the value of asking good questions. I'll be writing more about that in future posts.

Whenever we commit time to something it's helpful to ask *What is it for?*. 

So you know whether you should spend your time reading ...

What is this blog for? It's for me to share some of the things I've learned. With you. The different hats I wear are software developer, parent, football coach, reader and perpetual student. I'm an INFJ personality type, which means I'm interested in people, and often express myself better in writing. The thread that brings my work together is technology, and perspectives on mental health.

We also need to ask *Who is it for?* It's for me, to practise writing. And for you, if you find something here that resonates. I hope you'll get in touch if it does, so we can continue the conversation.

My intention is to turn up regularly, with generosity, and [show my work](https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/).
