I wrote yesterday about my first attempt at blogging, which taught me that I need a theme. Prompted by [Scott's book](https://www.amazon.com/Stoic-Creative-Struggling-Creatives-Passion-ebook/dp/B07464C6CP) I [identified my values](http://www.viacharacter.org/www/) and then my [Body of Work](https://www.amazon.com/Body-Work-Finding-Thread-Together-ebook/dp/B00DMCV5RK), by answering these questions:

* What do you want to create? (books, blog posts, code, classes, software)
* Who do you want to help?
* What wil happen as a result of investing your time and energy in this project? Is it important to you? Is it important to your community?
* Why you? What unique perspecitve or experience do you bring to this work?
* Is it worth trying, even if it fails miserably?
* If not now, when?

I realised that my mission is using technology in a positive way, to improve physical and mental health. This is something I could write about regulalry, and blend it with some of my own personal perspective. 

In Seth's [interview](https://tim.blog/2016/02/10/seth-godin/) with Tim Ferriss he talks about why everyone should blog daily. I decided to try this.

I've managed two days on, two days off and then four days consecutively. Now I have momentum, I want to keep going. I'm reminded of Jerry Seinfeld's productivity secret to keep producing work: [Don't Break The Chain](https://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret).

These are beneficial changes I've noticed so far:

* The motivation to ship a post leads to thinking about the [process](https://sivers.org/7) of writing and how to improve writing style. 
* It's uncomfortable not knowing what you're going to write tomorrow; but doing it anyway
* A practice of recording ideas and journaling develops. And creating space the quiet for this to happen.
* Half-baked ideas need to be fleshed out which leads to deeper investigation and more focus
* Reading for its own sake is replaced by reading in order to share something, which benefits others
* Writing helps me to see more clearly what I'm thinking and the patterns over time
* Readers notice things that you hadn't and broaden your perspective
* Our work in a company is often constrained to following an approach that someone else has prescribed; writing allows us to speak in our own voice
* With limited time we make conscious choices to prioritise what we need to get the work done

If you write regularly I'd love to hear your experience on what's worked, what you've found challenging, and the benefits you've gained.
