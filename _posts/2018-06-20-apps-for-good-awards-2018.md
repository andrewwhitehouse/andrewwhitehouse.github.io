# Apps for Good Awards 2018

Tonight I went to the Apps for Good awards. [Apps for Good](https://www.appsforgood.org/) is a free programme which provides [courses](https://www.appsforgood.org/public/teach-apps-for-good) that schools can include in their curriculum covering app development, Internet of Things and, next year, machine learning. These programme also has a network of experts who can share their expertise with the children through Skype calls, and help develop the ideas.

What I love about this programme is the way it helps to build the children's confidence, and to develop and pitch their ideas. It was a busy evening and the children worked really hard explaining their ideas repeatedly to interested attendees.

I ran out of time to speak to all the teams but did see these:

* [Rewardo](https://www.appsforgood.org/public/awards/2018/rewardo) - from an amazing group of year 5 students with excellent pitching skills. Rewardo allows you to earn outdoor family activities; I liked that the reward was itself focused on benefiting the family. When they won the Digital Explorer's awards thre were tears of joy and hugs from their teacher.

* [REnlightenment](https://www.appsforgood.org/public/awards/2018/renlightenment) - great idea for promoting shared understanding; an augmented reality app which you point at the religious shape (cross/minaret/...) and it tells you about that religion. With quizzes.

* [Hi School](https://www.appsforgood.org/public/awards/2018/hi-school) was developed by a group to help those for whom English isn't their first language in school; pairs you up with a learning buddy.

* [imagitale](https://www.appsforgood.org/public/awards/2018/imagitale) encourages young readers to engage with fairy tales by including themselves in the story through photos and recordings. I received a very confident pitch from Raees while I was walking between stands.

* [Kognition](https://www.appsforgood.org/public/awards/2018/kognition) is a system that helps students who find it difficult to ask or answer questions in class do so via an app. The app also allows teachers to track how the students are feeling through the lesson with a Red-Amber-Green traffic light system.

* [Light Bike](https://www.appsforgood.org/public/awards/2018/light-bike) was the winner in the Emerging Tech category for an enhanced bike to help you stay safe and visible while cycling. The attached LEDs turn red when the bike it braking.

I also spoke to one of the Fellows, who was a previous award winner. He is now judging and his excitement at still being involved was palpable. Now he's applying to university, and has a very strong story to add to his personal statement.

If you work in the tech industry, you can share your experience by [becoming an expert](https://www.appsforgood.org/public/get-involved/become-an-expert). 

If you're a head or ICT teacher, the team at Apps for Good are happy to [provide guidance](https://www.appsforgood.org/public/about-us#contact-us) on delivering the course. And it really is free, for non-fee paying schools.

And if you're a parent, please mention it to your school. Your children will gain so much from it.
