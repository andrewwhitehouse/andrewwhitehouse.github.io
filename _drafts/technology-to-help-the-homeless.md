Working in London I usually walk past people sleeping rough. Sometimes I give them money, and sometimes I don't.

Should we give money to homeless people? https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/17/should-give-homeless-people-money-gloucester-council-ad

When I was with Chordiant (now Pega Systems) in 2000 I worked for a while up in Glasgow. Flights were from City Airport and the cab driver used to cut through Cable Street. I remember reading an obituary of [Bill Fishman](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11480782/Professor-Bill-Fishman-East-End-historian-obituary.html)  who took part in the Battle of Cable Street, and grew up in th East End like my mum and Nana.. 

Obituaries provide a fascinating biographical insight into the person and a celebration of their life's work. They also remind us of our own mortality and ask us to consider the story we're writing with our own lives. Seneca reminds us that [Life is Long, If You Know How To Use It](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/09/01/seneca-on-the-shortness-of-life/).

I noticed this section:

> Recalling that his grandfather, a rabbi, never passed a beggar without giving a donation, he said: “I asked him once what if the man was a scrounger or a drug addict? My grandfather said: 'Let that always be on his conscience, never yours.’ ”

Interesting.

When I ran the London Marathon in 2010 and 2011 the first time I ran for [Sentebale](http://sentebale.org/who-we-are/), having visited Lesotho in 2009 and seen the problems the country has with AIDS and HIV. In the process of raising sponsorship I had an exchange with a colleague who declined to sponsor me because he felt that not enough would go to the people it's designed to help. This seemed to be an objection to charities in general, and not specifically aimed at Sentebale ([2016/17 report accounts](http://3nci582v3ztm44c7lq3ruz2z.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/LR-2016_17-SB-Report-and-Accounts_complete.pdf).

Should we give money directly to a homeless person on the street? How much? And assuming we don't have unlimited funds, should we prioritise? And if we were to prioritise, do we have enough information to make an informed decision?

The UK is currently goverened by a group of people who mostly have little empathy for those who are struggling. Some people get into difficulty through circumstances beyond their control, or lack of education. Or can [no longer afford their rising rent](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/may/23/homeless-teachers-ashamed-housing-crisis-professionals). Where the state fails to look after its people, charities and social entrepreneurs step in.

Here's a collection of interesting start ups I've found working in this area via [ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/3610563e-3cb8-11e8-b9f9-de94fa33a81e),
