In 2006 to 2009 I had a go at blogging. I wrote about meetups and conferences I attended, plus a few other things that animated me. I wrote 69 posts and stopped around in October 2009. I wasn't clear what it was for, and I didn't have a theme.

Most of my time was devoted to my freelance work or my young family. I felt that there were others who were more qualified to write about the intracies of building software, and confidentiality prevented writing about some clients. I also didn't consider myself an authority on parenting!

I've always loved reading, mainly about entrepreneurship, and have been looking for ways that I can build useful things, while supporting my family. I did build the Retweeter which is used by around 8,000 people; I've kept other projects under wraps because I wasn't sure they'd be used. 

My upbringing, and going to boarding school, has made me independent and inclined to figuring stuff out by myself. There have been a few books that have shaped my thinking. In The Dip Seth Godin asks "what can you be the best at?". Hugh Macleod talks about "". I studied the Lean Startup and went to workshops. Paid attention to Paul Graham who said, build something that people want. Derek Sivers says you shouldn't start a business unless someone asks you to (and has other helpful advice on his blog). Steven Pressfield talks about the practice of a professional, and not investing your ego in your work. 

The altMBA taught me to use good questions as a way of framing a situation and when you feel like you're stumbling that you're falling forward; also acting in the face of fear and discomfort; being comfortable that you may create something and nobody may say "that was good". Before the altMBA these things would have held me back.

Seth Godin is a brilliant teacher of marketing, and I see his style of empathetic marketing supporting that MVP you want to build in the Lean Startup. You'll see me mention him frequently. Not because I listen only to him, but because he has produced such a rich body of material.

So over the past 10 years I've been figuring stuff out. 

Now what?

I have all of this stuff that I've been doing which isn't visible. I want to share it, and find people who have similar interests to me.

Learning for its own sake
learn by building things

I still wasn't sure what was my thing. What I was passionate about. Reading Cal Newport gave me the perspective that you shouldn't follow your passion. Be So Good That They Can't Ignore You. There are two books that I've ready recently that have given me clarity on this. Creative on Purpose is by Scott Perry and brings together (very well) the assertions that we are all creative, and the Stoic idea that we all have good work in us and it's our duty to put it out into the world. Another altMBA colleague Trudy mentioned Body of Work by Pamela Slim. I'll be writing up my notes on these in future posts.

I've come to the conclusion that my unique areas of expertise are mental health and technology. My father died from suicide when I was 4 years old, and I've also learned about mental health while supporting other family members. With this, I have the opportunity to share what I've learned, which I hope will help others. 

This excerpt from What To Do When It's Your Turn has been my home screen for at least the past year. 

This blog is the first step in my journey of sharing this experience, and shipping the change I seek to make.


If I think about those 10 years I can beat myself up about the startup that I haven't achieved. Or I can acknowledge that I've been working hard for my family and the journey I've been on of figuring out my Body of Work has got me to this point.
