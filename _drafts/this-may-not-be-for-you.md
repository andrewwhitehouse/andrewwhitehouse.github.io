title:  "Why This May Not Be For You"
---

This blog may not be for you<sup>*</sup>, if ...

You want a blog on only one subject because it's too time-consuming having to read the posts first to figure out whether it's on a topic that interests you.

Reading about someone balancing constraints while endeavouring to behave authentically and make positive change just isn't that interesting to you.

Maybe you don't want to read about someone who's fairly advanced in their career and isn't a "successful" entrepreneur. Anyone who hasn't made it by this stage probably isn't worth listening to.

Perhaps you're earlier in your career and you can't see how my experience of freelancing in different companies could help you.

You're not clear on the theme behind the books I'm reading. If you summarise them for me, though, that could be useful.

If I write about growing up without a dad would that sound like "poor me"? How could that be turned into something constructive? Maybe you also grew up without a dad so you know what it's like and you don't need another perspective. 

If you have plenty of your life ahead of you and you don't feel any urgency to figure out what is the thing that your unique blend of experience and skill mean you should be doing.

You don't want to read about someone blathering on about empathy. That seems too much like hard work.

You don't see yet what this can offer you. The books I'm reading really don't interest you. That we all have a job to do. That understanding ourselves better helps us to feel that we are living authentically.

I haven't built a successful company, as far as you can tell.

You know that mental health is an issue for some people these days, but it doesn't affect me or my family.

You don't have any interest in using technology to solve problems, and you don't have children who might want to learn those skills.

\* This post is to help me be really clear on who it _is_ for, so I can develop those themes in my writing.
