Book One - The Amateur Life

# The Human Condition

The Daily Show reported recently that scientists in Japan had invented a robot that is capable of recognising its own reflection in a matter.
“When the robot learns to hate what it sees,” said Jon Stewart, “it will have achieved full humanity.”

## Three Models of Self-Transformation

The thesis of this book is that what ails you and me has nothing to do with us being sick [the therapeutic model] or wrong [the moralistic model]. What ails us is that we are living our lives as amateurs.

The solution, this book suggests is that we turn pro. Turning pro is free, but it’s not easy.

When we turn pro, we give up a life with which we may have become extremely comfortable. We give up a self that we have come to identify with and to call our own. We may have to give up friends, lovers, even spouses.

Turning pro is free, but it demands sacrifice.

We pass through a membrane when we turn pro. It hurts. It’s messy and it’s scary. We tread in blood when we turn pro.

Turning pro is not for everyone. We have to be a little crazy to do it, or even want to. In many ways the passage chooses us; we don’t choose it. We simply have no alternative.

What we get when we turn pro is, we find our power. We find out will and our voice and we find our self-respect. We become who we always were but had, until then, been afraid to embrace and live out.

## My Life as an Amateur

[…] It took me a long time to come to terms with the idea that I had ambition. I felt guilty about it. Who was I to aspire to “rise above” my brothers and sisters or to aim to be “better” than anybody else?

[In the halfway house where I was living] Everyone had fallen a long way, fallen hard, and fallen alone. Everyone in that house had looked their own annihilation in the face and it had scare the hell out of them.

[…] The house had no electricity, no toilet, no running water, and no heat. It had a front door but no back door. There were no windows and no furniture. I slept on a mattress that I pushed into a corner where the rain couldn’t reach it. I cooked my meals outdoors in the back, over a fire of pine kindling that I collected from the woods.

[…] Ambition, I have come to believe, is the most primal and sacred fundament of our being. To feel ambition and to act upon it is to embrace the unique calling of our souls. Not to act upon that ambition is to turn our back on ourselves and on the reason for our existence.

## My Smith-Corona

[...] Fear and shame hung over me and over that house, just as they permeated every crack and cranny of the halfway house back in town. I was terrified of sitting down at that [typewriter] and trying to write something, and ashamed of myself because I knew I was terrified, but I was still too scared to act.

My ambition was to write, but I had buried it so deep that it only peeked out in dreams and moments of insight that appeared at odd instants and then vanished without a trace.

Everything I was doing in my outer life was a consequence and an expression of that terror and that shame.

## Shadow Careers

Sometimes, when we’re terrified of embracing our true calling, we’ll pursue a shadow calling instead.

That shadow career is a metaphor for our real career. Its shape is similar, its contours feel tantalisingly the same. But a shadow career entails no real risk.

[…] Are you working in a support capacity for an innovator because you’re afraid to risk becoming an innovator yourself?

If you’re dissatisfied with your current life, ask yourself what your current life is a metaphor for.

That metaphor will point you toward your true calling.

## My Shadow Career

My shadow career was driving tractor-trailers. […] What I was really doing was running away from writing. Driving trucks was for me a shadow version of writing, because being a truck driver was, in my imagination, powerful and manly (just as I imagined being a writer could be).

[…] Then there was the romance of “the road”. I loved the road because it always took you somewhere. You were never stuck in one place. Delivering a load to a factory or warehouse, I could hang with the locals and shoot the breeze — but I always know that, while they were trapped, I was free. […]

Of course this was all self-delusion. The road was taking me nowhere.

I wasn’t writing books. I wasn’t facing my demons. I was spectating at life through the movie screen of a cab-over windshield, while every mile I travelled only carried me farther away from where I needed to go and from who I needed to become.

## Three Cheers for the Amateur Life

Before we begin ruthlessly deconstructing the amateur life, let’s pause for a moment to give it its due.

The amateur life is our youth. It’s our hero’s journey.

No one is born a pro. You’ve got to fall before you hit bottom, and sometimes that fall can be a hell of a ride.

So here’s to blackouts and divorces, to lost jobs and lost cash and lost self-respect. Here’s to time on the street. Here’s to years we can’t remember. Here’s to bad friends and cheating spouses — and to us, too, for being guilty of both.

Becoming a pro, in the end, is nothing grander than growing up.

## The Shadow Life

In the shadow life, we live in denial and we act by addiction.

We pursue calling that take us nowhere and permit ourselves to be controlled by compulsions that we cannot understand (or are not aware of) and whose outcomes serve only to keep us caged, unconscious and going nowhere.

The shadow life is the life of the amateur. In the shadow life we pursue false objects and act upon inverted ambitions.

The shadow life, the life to eh amateur and the addict, is not benign.

The longer we cleave to this life, the farther we drift from our true purpose, and the harder it becomes for us to rally the courage to get back.

## Addicted to Love
I have a friend who’s addicted to love. […] She migrates from one passionate all-consuming affair to the next. She is in agony throughout the affair, and the affair always ends in agony. [This woman] is one of the most gifted, talented people I’ver ever met. She’s a piano prodigy. Her photographs win prizes. And she’s a near-world-class athlete.

Over the years, my friend has developed a philosophy — you could almost call it a religion — about pursuing the sublime through love.

[…] My friend knows this is Resistance. We’ve talked about it a hundred times. She’s running away from her gifts and she knows it. But the habit is too strong. She has become identified with it. It’s who she is.

## Habits

This book is about habits.

The difference between an amateur and a professional is in their habits. An amateur has amateur habits. A professional has professional habits.

We can never free ourselves from habits. The human being is a creature of habit. But we can replace bad habits with good ones.

[…] It may help, as a jumping off place, to consider the interior world of the most passionate and tragic creature of habit — the addict.

## Beautiful Losers

Have you ever noticed that addicts are often extremely interesting people?

Addiction itself is excruciatingly boring. It’s boring because it’s predictable — the lies, the evasions, the transparent self-justifications and self-exonerations. But the addict himself is often a colourful and fascinating person.

It has has been a substance abuser for any length of time, his story often reads like a novel, packed with drama, conflict and intrigue. If the addict’s drug of choice is alcohol, the narrative is frequently one of job loss, domestic abuse, divorce, abandonment of children, bankruptcy.

## Art and Addiction

For the past several years, I’ve written a weekly post on my website www.stevenpressfield.com called “Writing Wednesdays”. Far and away, the most popular entries in that space have been in my “Artist and Addict” series. One of the points these posts made was that there’s not a big difference between an artist and an addict.

Many artists are addicts, and vice versa. Many are artists in one breath and addicts in another.

## What’s the difference?

The addict is the amateur; the artist is the professional.

Both addict and artist are dealing with the same material, which is the pain of being human and the struggle against self-sabotage. But the addict/amateur and the artist/professional deal with these elements in fundamentally different ways.

(When I say “addiction”, by the way, I’m not referring only to the serious, clinical maladies of alcoholism, drug dependence, domestic abuse and so forth. Web-surfing counts too. So do compulsive texting, sexting, twittering and Facebooking.)

## Distractions. Displacement activities.

When we’re living as amateurs, we’re running away from our calling — meaning our work, our destiny, the obligation to become our truest and highest selves.

Addiction becomes a surrogate for our calling. We enact the addiction instead of embracing the calling. Why? Because to follow a calling requires work. It’s hard. It hurts. It demands entering the pain-zone of effort, risk, and exposure.

So we take the amateur route instead. Instead of composing our symphony, we create a “shadow symphony”, of which we ourselves are the orchestra, the conductor, the composer, the audience. Our life becomes a shadow drama, a shadow start-up company, a shadow philanthropic venture.

My life used to be a shadow novel. It had plot, characters, sex scenes, action scenes. It had mood, atmosphere, texture. It was scary, it was weird, it was exciting. I had friends who were living out shadow movies, or creating shadow art, or initiating shadow industries. These were our addictions, and we worked for them for all they were worth. There was only one problem: none of us was writing a real novel, or painting a real painting, or starting a real business. We were amateurs living in the past or dreaming of the future, while failing utterly to do the work necessary to progress in the present.

When you turn pro, your life gets very simple.

The Zen monk, the artist, the entrepreneur often lead lives so plain they’re practically invisible.

The amateur is an egotist. He takes the material of his personal pain and uses it to draw attention to himself. He creates a “life”, a “character”, a “personality”.

The artist and the professional, on the other hand, have turned a corner in their minds. They have succeeded in stepping back from themselves. They have grown so board with themselves and so sick of their petty bullshit that they can manipulate those elements the way a HazMat technician handles weapons-grade plutonium.

They manipulate them for the good of others. What were once their shadow symphonies become real symphonies. The colour and drama that were once outside now move inside.

Turning Pro is an act of self-abnegation. Not self with a capital-S, but little-s self. Ego. Distraction. Displacement. Addiction.

When we turn pro, the energy that once went into the Shadow Novel goes into the real novel. What we once thought was real — “the world”, including its epicentre, ourselves — turns out only to be a shadow. And what had seemed to be only a dream ourselves, now, the reality of our lives.

## Art and Addiction

The pre-addictive individual — i.e., you and I when we’re young — experiences a calling. To art, to service, to honourable sacrifice. In other words, we experience positive aspiration. A vision of the higher, realised self we might become.

The intimation of this calling is followed immediately by the apparition of Resistance.

Fear. Self-doubt. Self-sabotage.

What makes this moment so soul-precarious is that most of us are unconscious, in the event, of both our aspirations and our Resistance. We’re asleep.

We know only that something is wrong and we don’t know how to fix it. We’re restless. We’re bored. We’re angry. We burn to accomplish something great, but we don’t know where to begin and, even if we did, we’d be so terrified that we still couldn’t talk a step. Enter: a drink, a lower, a habit. Addiction replaces aspiration.

The quick fix wins out over the long, slow haul.

## Addictions and Shadow Careers

When we can’t stand the fear, the shame, and the self-reproach that we feel, we obliterate it with an addiction.

The addiction becomes the shadow version, the evil twin of our calling to service or to art.

That’s why addicts are so interesting and so boring at the same time.

They’re interesting because they’re called to something — something new, something unique, something that we, watching, can’t wait to see them bring forth into manifestation.

At the same time, they’re boring because they never do the work.

Instead, the addict enacts his aspiration in shadow form. The addiction becomes his novel, his adventure, his great love. The work of art or service that might have been produced is replaced by the drama, the conflict, and suffering of the addict’s crazy, haunted shattered life.

## Why I Don’t Knock Addiction

Addictions are not “bad”. They are simply the shadow forms of a more noble and exalted calling.

Our addictions are our callings themselves, only encrypted and incognito.

Addictions and shadow careers are messages in a bottle from our unconscious. Our Self, in the Jungian sense, is trying to get our attention, to have an intervention with us.

The question we need to ask of a shadow career or an addiction is the same question the psychotherapist asks of a dream. “What is our unconscious trying to tell us?"

## Pulling The Pin

The term “pulling the pin” comes from the old days of riding the rails. To uncouple one car from another, the train crew pulled a heavy steel pin out of the coupling mechanism.

In migrant lingo, pulling the pin meant quitting. You’d wake up and the bunk next to you would be empty.

[A guy called Dave who I worked with said] “Hard liquor will destroy your liver. […] Good whisky is expensive and the cheap stuff is poison? Beer? You have to drink a case minimum to get where you need to get. If you don’t have a car how can you carry it? Plus, you’re pissing all night long. Wine is best. You can get a decent buzz on a bottle or two, and the stuff is made, at least partly, from a natural product — grapes. Who knows there might even be a tad of nutrition in there."

## The Definition of Boring

Something that’s boring goes nowhere. It travels in a circle. It never arrives at its destination.

The repetitive nature of shadow life and of addiction is what makes both so tedious. No traction is ever gained. No progress is made. We’re stuck in the same endlessly-repeating loop. That’s what makes addiction like hell.

All addictions share, among others, two primary qualities.

- They embody repetition without progress
- The produce incapacity as a payoff

## The Payoff of Incapacity

My friend has used the pursuit of love to produce incapacity, and it worked for her for decades. Her multiple talents have gone unexplored, untried and unrealised. She has become a version of herself, but it is a shadow version, an introverted version, a crippled version. She is miserable and she cannot, or will not, change.

Distraction and displacement seem innocent on the surface. How can we be harming ourselves by having fun, or seeking romance, or enjoying the fruits of this big, beautiful world?

But lives go down the tubes one repetition at a time, one deflection at a time, one hundred and forty characters at a time.

The following is a sampling in no particular order, of garden-variety addictions that fall short of hard-code chemical dependency but are still more than potent enough to cripple, mal-form and destroy our lives.

## Addicted to Failure

The lure of failure can be as intoxicating as the hardest of hard-core narcotics. Its payoff is incapacity. When we fail, we are off the hook. We have given ourselves a Get Out of Jail free card. We no longer have to ask Stanislavsky’s famous three questions: Who am I? Why am I here? What do I want?

## Addicted to Sex

My own theory is that the obsessive pursuit of ex is an attempt to obliterate the ego, i.e. “normal” consciousness, the monkey-mind that tortures us with restlessness, fear, anger, and self-centredness.

We’re trying to get to the level above that.

The entity we’re seeking union with is ourselves.

We’re trying to connect with our true being, our soul, our Self.

## Addicted to Distraction

Resistance hates two qualities above all others: concentration and depth. Why? Because when we work with focus and we work deep, we succeed.

Resistance wants to keep us shallow and unfocused. So it makes the superficial and the vain intoxicating.

Have you checked your email in the last half hour?

When you sit down to do your work, do you leave your web connection on?

It can be fatal, keeping up wth the Kardashians.

## Addicted to Money

The real utility of money is its convenience as a medium of exchange.

But when we’re addicted to money, we become hooked on the metaphor.

Is money how we keep score? Is it magic? Is wealth a currency that opens door, realises possibilities, produces transcendence?

Money is second only to sex in the richness of its metaphor. But, as in the case of carnality, our real object is the currency of our own hearts. (The same premise applies to power, fame and all other external expressions of potency.)

What you and I are really seeking is our own voice, our own truth, our own authenticity.

## Addicted to Trouble

The individual addicted to trouble will never get out of jail, because he is safer behind bars than free out in the world. each time he is released, he will find a way to get sent back.

The payoff for the prisoner is release from the agonising imperative of identifying, embracing and bringing into material existence the dreams and visions of his own deepest, noblest, and most honourable heart.

## My Year of Turning Pro

I didn’t talk to anybody during my year of turning pro. I didn’t hang out. I just worked. I had a book in mind and I had decided I would finish it or kill myself. I could not run away again, or let people down again, or let myself down again. This was it, do or die.

I had no TV, no radio, no music. No sex, no sports. I didn’t read the newspaper.

## The Pain of Being Human

The Gnostics believed that exile was the essential condition of man. [I agree.]

The artist and the addict both wrestle with this experience of exile. They share an acute, even excruciating sensitivity to the state of separation and isolation, and both actively seek a way to overcome it, to transcend it, or at least to make the pain go away.

What is the pain of the human condition?

It’s the condition of being suspended between two worlds and being unable to fully enter into either.

As mortal flesh, you and I cannot ascend to the upper realm. That sphere belongs to the gods. But we can’t put it out of our minds either. We can’t escape intimations and half memories of … what?

Our lot, instead, is to dwell here in the lower realm, the sphere of the temporal and the material — the time-bound dimensions of instincts and animal passions, or hate and desire, aspiration and fear.

## Jewish Despair and Irish Despair

Here’s a passage from Killing Rommel:

“Jewish despair arises from want and can be cured by surfeit. Give a penniless Jew fifty quid and he perks right up. Irish despair is different. Nothing relieves Irish despair. The Irishman’s complaint lies not with his circumstances, which might be rendered brilliant by labour or luck, but with the injustice of existence itself. Death!

How could a benevolent Deity gift us with life, only to set such a cruel term upon it? Irish despair knows no remedy. Money can’t help. Love fades. Fame is fleeting. The only cures are booze and sentiment. That’s why the Irish are such noble drunks and such glorious poets."

## The Pain of Being Human, Part Two

The addict seeks to escape the pain of being human in one of two ways — by transcending it or be anaesthetising it.

Borne aloft by powerful enough chemicals we can almost, if we’re lucky, glimpse the face of the Infinite. If that doesn’t work, we can always pass out. Both ways work. The pain goes away.

The artist takes a different tack. She tries to reach the upper realm not by chemicals but by labour and love.

(When I say “artist”, I mean as well the lower, the holy man, the engineer, the mother, the warrior, the inventor, the singer, the sage, and the voyager. And remember, addict and artist can be one and the same and often are, moment to moment.)

If the upper realm is, as Plato suggested, the sphere of perfect love, truth, justice, and beauty then the artist seeks to call down the magic of this world and to create, by dint of labour and luck, the closest-to-sublime simulacrum of these qualities that he or she can.

This pursuit produces, for the artist, peace of mind.

# Book Two
# Self-Inflicted Wounds

## Accidental Incapacitation

The habits and addictions of the amateur are conscious or unconscious self-inflicted wounds. Their payoff is incapacity. When we take our [gun] and blow a hole in our foot, we no longer have to face the real fight of our lives, which is to become who we are and to realise our destiny and our calling.

## A Definition of the Amateur

The amateur is young and dumb. He’s innocent, he’s good-hearted, he’s well-intentioned. The amateur is brave.

He’s inventive and resourceful. He’s willing to take a chance.

The amateur is not evil or crazy. He’s not deluded. He’s not demented. The amateur is trying to learn.

## The Amateur is Terrified

Fear is the primary colour of the amateur’s interior world. Fear of failure, fear of success, fear of looking foolish, fear of under-achieving and fear of over-achieving, fear of poverty, fear of loneliness, fear of death.

But mostly what we all fear as amateurs is being excluded from the tribe, i.e. the gang, the posse, mother and father, family, nation, race, religion.

The amateur fears that if he turns pro and lives out his calling, he will have to live up to who he really is and what he is truly capable of.

The amateur is terrified that if the tribe should discover who is really is, he will be kicked out into the cold to die.

## The Professional is Terrified Too

The professional, by the way, is just as terrified as the amateur. In fact the professional may be more terrified because she is more acutely aware of herself and of her interior universe.

The difference […] lies in the way the professional acts in the face of fear.

## The Amateur is an Egotist

The amateur identifies with his own ego. He believes he is “himself”. That’s why he’s terrified.

The amateur is a narcissist. He views the world hierarchically. He continuously rates himself in relation to others, becoming self-inflated if his fortunes rise, and desperately anxious if his star should fall.

The Amateur Lives by the Opinions of Others

Though the amateur’s identity is seated in his own ego, that ego is so weak that is cannot define itself based on its own self-evaluation. The amateur allows his worth and identity to be defined by others.

## The amateur craves third-party validation.

He is imprisoned by what he believes he ought to think, how he ought to look, what he ought to do, and who he ought to be.

## The Amateur Permits Fear to Stop Him from Acting

Paradoxically, the amateurs self-inflation prevents him from acting. He takes himself and the consequences of his actions so seriously that he paralyses himself.

The amateur fears, above all else, becoming (and being seen and judged as) himself.

Becoming himself means being different from others and thus, possibly, violating the expectations of the tribe, without whose acceptance and approval, he believes, he cannot survive.

By these means, the amateur remains inauthentic. He remains someone other than who he really is.

## The Amateur is Easily Distracted

The amateur fears solitude and silence because she needs to avoid, at all costs, the voice inside her head that would point her toward her calling and her destiny. So she seeks distraction.

The amateur prizes shallowness and shuns depth. The culture of Twitter and Facebook is paradise for the amateur.

## The Amateur Seeks Instant Gratification

The amateur, the addict and the obsessive all want what they want now. The corollary is that, when they get it, it doesn’t work.

The Amateur Is Jealous

Because the amateur is so powerfully identified with herself, she finds it extremely difficult to view the world through the eyes of others. The amateur is often unkind and insensitive to others, but she saves her most exquisite cruelty for herself.

The amateur’s fear eclipses her compassion for others and for herself.

## The Amateur Lacks Compassion for Himself

In his heart, the amateur knows he’s hiding. He knows he was meant for better things. He knows he has turned away from his higher nature.

If the amateur had empathy for himself, he could look in the mirror and not hate what he sees.

Achieving this compassion is the first powerful step toward moving from being an amateur to a pro.

## The Amateur Seeks Permission

The amateur believes that, before she can act, she must receive permission from some Omnipotent Other — a lover, a spouse, a parent, a boss, a figure of authority.

## The Amateur Lives for the Future

The amateur and the addict focus exclusively on the product and the payoff. Their concern is what’s in it for them, and how soon and how cheaply they can get it.

[…]

My beef with American culture is that almost every aspect, including the deliberations of the legislature and the judiciary, has been debased to pander to the culture of amateurism. The promise that our products and politicians proffer is the promise one might make to an infant or addict: “I will get you what you want, and it will cost you nothing”.

## The Amateur Lives in the Past

Because the amateur owns nothing of spirit in the present, she either looks forward to a hopeful future or backward to an idyllic past. But the past evoked by the amateur is make-believe. It never existed. It’s a highlight reel that she edited together from events that almost took place or should have occurred.

[,,,]

The payoff of living in the past or the future is you never have to do your work in the present.

## The Amateur Will Be Ready Tomorrow

The sure sign of an amateur is he has a million plans and they all start tomorrow.

## The Amateur Gives His Power Away to Others

Have you ever followed a guru or mentor? I have. I’ve given my power away to lovers and spouses. I’ve sat by the phone. I’ve waited for permission. I’ve turned in work and waited, trembling, the judgement of others.

[…]

Exile, failure, and banishment can be good things sometimes, because they force us to act from our own centre and not from someone else’s.

I applaud your story of how you hit bottom, because at the bottom there’s no one there but yourself.

## The Amateur is Asleep

The force that can save the amateur is awareness, particularly self-awareness. But the amateur understands, however dimly, that if she truly achieved this knowledge, she would be compelled to act upon it.

To act upon this self-awareness would mean defining herself, i.e differentiating herself from the tribe and thus making herself vulnerable to rejection, expulsion, and all the other fear that self-definition elicits.

Fear of self-definition is what keeps an amateur an amateur and what keeps an addict an addict.

## The Tribe Doesn’t Give a Shit

The amateur dreads becoming who she really is because she fears that this new person will be judged by others as “different”. The tribe will declare us “weird” or “queer” or “crazy”. The tribe will reject us.

Here’s the truth: the tribe doesn’t give a shit. There is no tribe.

That gang or posse that we imagine is sustaining us by the bonds we share is in fact a conglomeration of individuals who are just as fucked up as we are and just as terrified. Each individual is so caught up in his own bullshit that he doesn’t have two seconds to worry about yours or mine, or to reject or diminish us because of it.

When we truly understand that the tribe doesn’t give a damn, we’re free. There is no tribe, and there never was.

Our lives are entirely up to us.

## Part-Time Pros

Sometimes we can be professionals in our shadow careers but amateurs in our true calling.

How many creative directors at ad agencies have unfinished novels and screenplays sitting in their office drawers? How many lawyers and doctors do you know who would make sensational essayists or novelists or historians but, beyond the off op-ed submission, never propel themselves past literary first base? I know producers who yearn to be directors, moms who are itching to launch start-ups, grad students who could solve climate change.

Sometimes the reason we choose these careers (consciously or unconsciously) is to produce incapacity.

Resistance is diabolical. It can harness our drive for greatness and our instinct for professionalism and yoke them, instead, to a shadow profession, who’s demands will keep us from turning our energies toward their true cause.

Sometimes it’s easier to be a professional in a shadow career than it is to turn pro in our real calling.

## Life Gets Very Simple When You Turn Pro

What happens when we turn pro is, we finally listen to that still, small voice inside our heads. At last we find the courage to identify the secret dream or love or bliss that we have known all along was our passion, our calling, our destiny.

This, we acknowledge at last, is what we are most afraid of. This is what we know in our hearts we have to do.

## How Your Life Changes When You Turn Pro

Before we turn pro, our life is dominated by fear and Resistance. We live in a state of denial. We’re denying the voice in our heads. We’re denying our calling. We’re denying who we really are.

We’re fleeing from our fear into an addiction or a shadow career.

What changes when we turn pro is we stop fleeing.

When we turn pro, we stop running from our fears. We turn around and face them.

## How Your Day Changes When You Turn Pro

When we turn pro, everything becomes simple. Our aims centre on the ordering of our days in such a way that we overcome the fears that have paralysed us in the past.

We now structure our hours not to flee from fear, but to confront it and overcome it.

We plan our activities in order to accomplish an aim. And we bring our will to bear so that we stick to this resolution.

This changes our days completely.

It changes what time we get up and it changes what time we go to bed. It changes what we do and what we don’t do. It changes the activities we engage in and with that attitude we engage in them. It changes what we read and what we eat. It changes the shape of our bodies.

When we were amateurs, our life was about drama, about denial and about distraction. Our days were simultaneously full to the bursting point and achingly, heartbreakingly empty.

But we are not amateurs any more. We are different, and everyone in our lives sees it.

## How People Change When You Turn Pro

Turning pro changes how we spend our time and with whom we spend it.

It changes our friends; it changes our spouses and children. It changes who is drawn to us and who is repelled by us.

Turning pro changes how people perceive us. Those who are still fleeing from their own fears will now try to sabotage us. They will tell us we’ve changes and try to undermine our efforts at further change. They will attempt to make us feel guilty for these changes. They will try to entice us to get stoned with the or fuck off with them or waste time with them, as we’ve done in the past, and when we refuse they will turn against us and talk us down behind our backs.

At the same time, new people will appear in our lives. They will be people who are facing their own fears and who are conquering them. These people will become our new friends.

When we turn pro, we will be compelled to make painful choices. There will be people who in the past had been colleagues and associates, even friends, who we will no longer be able to spend time with if our intention is to grow and evolve. We will have to choose between the life we want for our future and the life we have left behind.

## How Your Minds Changes When You Turn Pro

Turning pro is like kicking a drug habit or stopping drinking. It’s a decision, a decision to which we must re-commit every day.

Twelve-step programs say “One Day at a Time.” The professional says the same thing.

Each day, the professional understands, he will wake up facing the same demons, the same Resistance, the same self-sabotage, the same tendencies to shadow activities and amateurism that he has always faced.

The difference is that now he will not yield to those temptations.

He will have mastered them, and he will continue to master them.

## What Makes Us Turn Pro

Turning pro is a decision. But it’s such a monumental, life-overturning decision (and one that is usually made only in the face of overwhelming fear) that the moment is frequently accompanied by powerful drama and emotion. Often it’s something we’ve been avoiding for years, something we would never willingly face unless overwhelming events compelled us to.

Turning is it like Pearl Harbour or 9/11 or the assassination of President Kennedy. We never forget where we were when it happened.

## The Nature of Epiphanies

The essence of epiphanies is the stripping away of self-delusion. We thought we were X. Now suddenly we see we’re minus-X.

There is great power in this moment.

We’ve lost something, yes. A cherished self-delusion must be abandoned and this hurts.

But what we have gained in the truth. Our bullshit falls away. The scales drop from our eyes. In that moment we have two options;

We can reconstitute our bullshit.

Or we can turn pro.

## Shame Is Good

In the post-epiphanal moment, we have two things going of res that we didn’t have ninety seconds earlier: we have reality and we have humility. These are powerful allies.

And we have a third force working in our favour: shame. Why is shame good? Because shame can produce the final element we need to change our lives: will.

# Book Three: The Professional Mindset

## Qualities of the Professional

In The War of Art [Steven] listed the following as habits and qualities that the professional possesses that the amateur doesn’t:

- The professional shows up every day
- The professional stays on the job all day
- The professional is committed over the long haul
- For the professional, the stakes are high and real

Further:

- The professional is patient
- The professional seeks order
- The professional demystifies
- The professional acts in the face of fear
- The professional accepts no excuses
- The professional plays as it lays
- The professional is prepared
- The professional does not show off
- The professional dedicates himself to mastering technique
- The professional does not hesitate to ask for help
- The professional does not take failure or success personally
- The professional does not identity with his or her instrument
- The professional endures diversity
- The professional self-validates
- The professional reinvents herself
- The professional is recognised by other professionals

Here are a few other additional qualities before we move on to the higher expression of professionalism:

## A Professional Is Courageous

The professional displays courage, not only in the roles she embraces (which invariably scare the hell out of her) or the sacrifices she names (of time, love, family) or even in the enduring of criticism, blame, envy, and lack of understanding, but above all in the confronting of her own doubts and demons.

The linebacker and the Army Ranger go into action as part of a team. But the artist and the entrepreneur enter combat alone. I take my hat off to every man or woman who does this.

## The Professional Will Not Be Distracted

The amateur tweets. The pro works.

## The Professional Is Ruthless With Himself

The professional knows when he has failed short of his own standards. He will murder his darlings without hesitation, if that’s what it takes to stay true to the goddess and to his own expectations of excellence.

## The Professional Has Compassion For Herself

Picture the most sensitive person you’ve ever known; a horse is ten times more sensitive. A horse is a naked nervous system, particularly a thoroughbred. He’s a child.

A horse that loves to run will beat a horse that’s compelled every day of the week.

Never train your animal to exhaustion. Leave him wanting more.

## The Professional Lives in the Present

The amateur spends him time in the past and the future. He persists himself to fear and to hope.

The professional has taught himself to banish these distractions.

## The Professional Defers Gratification

Krishna said we have the right to our labour, but not to the fruits of our labour. He meant that the piano is its own reward, as it the canvas, the barre, and the movieola.

Fuck the marshmallows.

The Professional Does Not Wait for Inspiration

The professional does not wait for inspiration; he acts in anticipation of it.

He knows that when the Muse sees his butt in the chair, she will deliver.

The Professional Does Not Give His Power Away to Others

When we make someone into an icon, we give away our power. We say to ourselves (unconsciously), “The person possesses a quality I wish I possessed. Therefore I will worship this person in the hope that that quality will wear off on me, or I will acquire that quality by virtue of my proximity to this mentor/sensei/lover/teacher/hero."

In my experience, when we project a quality or virtue onto another human being, we ourselves almost always already possess that quality, but we’re afraid to embrace (and to live) that truth.

The amateur is an acolyte, a groupie. The professional make seek instruction or wisdom from one who is further along in mastery than he, be he does so without surrendering his self-sovereignty.

## The Professional Helps Others

The amateur hoards his knowledge and his reinforcement. He believes that if he shares what he possesses with others, he will lose it.

The professional is happy to teach. He will gladly lend a hand or deliver a swift kick. But there’s a caveat.

The professional refuses to be iconised. Not for selfish reasons, but because he knows how destructive the dynamic of ionisation is to the conifer. The pro wil share his wisdom with other professionals — or with amateurs who are committed to becoming professionals.

What About The Magic?

[The] pro mindset is a discipline that we use to overcome Resistance. To defeat the self-sabotaging habits of procrastination, self-doubt, susceptibility to distraction, perfectionism, and shallowness, we enlist the self-strengthening habits of order, regularity, discipline, and a constant striving after excellence. That’s not hard to understand.

But what about the magic? What about madness? What about flashes of brilliance and uncontrollable outbursts of genius? How does the professional mindset help there? Isn’t it too severe, too hardcore, too regimented? Answer: no.

The monk glimpses the face of God not by scaling a peak in the Himalayas, but by sitting still in silence.

Yoga, meditation, and the martial arts access the soul by way of the body.

The physical leads to the spiritual. The humble produces the sublime.

It seems counterintuitive, but it’s true: in order to achieve “flow”, magic, “the zone”, we start by being common and ordinary and workmanlike. We set our palms against the stones in the garden wall and search, search, search until at last, in the instant when we’re ready to give up, our fingers fasten upon the secret door.

A Marine Gets Two Salaries

There’s a well-known gunnery sergeant who, when his young marines complain about their pay, explains that they get two salaries: A financial salary and a psychological salary.

You and I, as artist and entrepreneurs, receive two salaries as well.

The first might be called conventional rewards — money, applause, attention. That kind is fine if we can get it. The problem for most of us is we can’t. We bust our butts training and practising and studying and rehearsing and nobody shows up, nobody notices, nobody even knows we exist. No wonder people quit. The struggle requires too much agony for too little payoff.

That’s the conventional reward.

Then there’s the psychological reward.

Remember, Krishna told Arjuna that he had the right to his labour, but not to the fruits of his labour. What he meant was conventional fruits.

Does the monk meditate only to achieve enlightenment? What if that never happens?

When we do the work for itself alone, our pursuit of a career (or a living or fame or wealth or notoriety) turns into something else, something loftier and nobler, which we may never even have thought about or aspired to at the beginning.

It turns into a practice.

[Steven’s] Years in the Wilderness

In a ways I was lucky that i experience failure for so many years. Because there were no conventional rewards, I was forced to ask myself, What am I doing this? Am I crazy? All my friends are making money and settling down and living normal lives. What the hell am I doing? Am I nuts? What’s wrong with me?

In the end I answered the question by realising that I had no choice. I couldn’t do anything else. When I tried, I got so depressed I couldn’t stand it. So when I wrote another novel or screenplay that I couldn’t sell, I had no choice but to write another after that. The truth was, I was enjoying myself.

Maybe nobody else liked the stuff I was doing, but I did. I was learning. I was getting better.

The work became, in its own demented way, a practice. It sustained me, and it sustains me still.

## The Professional Mindset as a Practice

To “have a practice” […] is to follow a rigorous, prescribed regimen with the intention of elevating the mind and the spirit to a higher level.

A practice implies engagement in a ritual. A practice may be defined as the dedicated, daily exercise of commitment, will, and focused intention aimed, on one level, at the achievement of mastery in a field but, on a loftier level, intended to produce a communion with a power greater than ourselves — call it whatever you like: God, minds, soul, Self, the Muse, the superconscious.

## A Practice Has a Space

A practice has a space, and that space is sacred.

There’s a wonderful book called Where Women Create. It’s a compilation of photos of studios and workshops where female artists do their magic.

What you’ll see [in this book] is:
Order
Commitment
Passion
Love
Intensity
Beauty
Humility

Twenty-six artists with twenty-six different personal odysseys. Many, no doubt, include divorce, heartbreak, alcoholism, you name it.

## A Practice Has a Time

You and I may have to operate in a more chaotic universe [than monks]. But the object remains the same: to approach the mystery via order, commitment and passionate intention.

When we convene day upon day in the same space at the same time, a powerful energy builds up around us. This is the energy of our intention, of our dedication, of our commitment.

The goddess sees this energy and she rewards it.

## A Practice Has Intention

Our intention as artists is to get better, to go deeper, to work closer and closer to the bone.

## We Come To a Practice As Warriors

The sword master stepping onto the fighting floor knows he will be facing powerful opponents. Not the physical adversaries whom he will first (though those indeed serve as stand-ins for the enemy).

The real enemy is inside himself.

## We Come to a Practice in Humility

We may bring intention and intensity to our practice (in fact we must), but not ego. Dedication, even ferocity, yes. But never arrogance.

The space of the practice is sacred. It belongs to the goddess. We take our shoes off before we enter. We press our palms together and we bow.

## A Practice is Lifelong

The Spartan king Agesilaus was still fighting in armour when he was eighty-two. Picasso was painting past ninety, and Henry Miller was chasing women at eighty-nine.

Once we turn pro, we’re like sharks who have tasted blood, or renunciants who have glimpsed the face of God. For us, there is no finish line. No bell ends the bout. Life is the pursuit. Life is the hunt. When our hearts burst … then we’ll go out, and no sooner.

Rosanne Cash’s Dream, Part Two

The specific details of acquiring professionalism evolve naturally. They’re self-evident.

The epiphany is everything. When we see the gaping holes in our practice (or discover that we have no practice at all), no one has to school us in time management or resource allocation.

We know what we have to do.

The other thing about the changes [we make after an epiphany] is that [we don’t] make those changes to earn more money, or achieve greater fame, or to sell more records. [We make] those changes out of respect for [our] craft. [We make] them to become a better artist [or] a more powerful musician.

## The Professional Trusts The Mystery

The professional trust the mystery. He knows that the Muse always delivers. She may surprise us. She may give us something we never expected. But she will always put something inside the box.

The following are five axioms, derived from this principle, that [Steven works by] every day:

## Work Over Your Head

Writers of fiction learn early that is is possible to write a character who is smarter than they are.

The place that we write from (or paint from or compose from or innovate from) is far deeper than our petty personal egos. That place is beyond intellect. It is deeper than rational thought.

It is instinct.

It is intuition.

It is imagination.

We can work over our heads. Not only can we, but we must.

The best pages [he’s] ever written are pages [he] can’t remember writing.

## Write What You Don’t Know

[Steve wrote a story] about prison. [He had] never been to prison. [He] didn’t know the first thing about prison. But [he] was so desperate that [he] plunged in, slinging bullshit with both hands and not looking back.

When he was done he showed the script to a few writers he knew.

More than one tugged him aside and asked in a whisper, “Steve, where did you do time?”.

Good things happen when we trust the Mystery.

There is always something inside the box.

## Take What the Defense Gives You

Every book [he writes] has at least one giant section that’s as tough as a knot in a plank of lumber. [He] can’t crack it head on. Attacking from the flank doesn’t work. The damn thing is just too stubborn.

Two key tenants for days when Resistance is really strong:

- Take what you can get and stay patient. The defence may crack late in the game.
- Play for tomorrow.

Our role on tough-nut days is to maintain our composure and keep chipping away. We’re pros. We’re not amateurs. We have patience. We can handle adversity.

Tomorrow the defence will give us more, and tomorrow we’ll take it.

There’s a third tenet that underlies the first two:

- We’re in this for the long haul.

Our work is a practice. One bad day is nothing to us. Ten bad days are nothing.

In the scheme of our lifelong practice, twenty-four hours when we can’t gain yardage is only a speed bump. We’ll forget it be breakfast tomorrow and be back again, ready to hurl our bodies into the fray.

## Play Hurt

The amateur believes that she must have all her ducks in a row before she can launch her start-up or compose her symphony or design her iPhone app.

The professional knows better.

Has your husband just walked out on you?

Has your El Dorado been repossessed?

Keep writing.

Keep composing.

Keep shooting film.

Athletes play hurt. Warriors fight scared.

The professional takes two aspirin and keeps on truckin’.

Sit Chilly

The professional knows that, in the course of her pursuit, she will inevitably experience moments of terror, even panic. She knows she can’t choke that panic back or wish it away. It’s there, and it’s for real.

The pro [horsewoman] sits chilly.

She focused on the horse and the wall. She keeps her seat.

## The Professional and the Primitive

As an artist, I seek to access unforeseen powers. Evil forces are out there — Resistance, self-doubt, self-sabotage. How many other malign entities are hovering each morning over me and my huevos rancheros?

Then there are the good forces. Inspiration, enthusiasm, courage. New ideas, brilliant breakthroughs, insights, intuitions. Where do these come from? I don’t know. How can I access them? I have no clue.

Yet this is my business. This is my life.

I have a code of professionalism. I have virtues that I seek to strengthen and vices that I labour to eradicate.

I serve the goddess. Where she tells me to go, I go.

## A Model of the Universe

Rabbi Mordecai Finley:

“There is a second self inside you — an inner, shadow Self. This self doesn’t care about you. It doesn’t love you. it has its own agenda and it will kill you. It will kill you like cancer. It will kill you to achieve its agenda, which is to prevent you from actualising your Self, from becoming who you really are. This shadow self is called, in the Kabbalistic lexicon, the yetzer hara. The yetzer hara, Steve, is what you would call Resistance."

In the Kabbalistic view of the world, the soul (neshama in Hebrew) is the source of all wisdom and goodness. the neshama seeks constantly to communicate to us — to our consciousness on the physical plane. The soul is trying to guide us, substain us, restore us.

But there is a force operating in opposition to the neshama. This entity, the yetzer hara, is a self-sustaining and cunning intelligence whose sole aim is to block us from accessing the neshama and to block the neshama from communicating to us.

Mussar

Mussar was a code of ethical discipline. It was not far from what we see today in twelve-step programs.

Its first tent was “identity the sin”. The second was “eliminate it”.

In AA terms this would mean:

- Acknowledge the condition of being an alcoholic
- Stop drinking

What the Kabbalists called hussar, Steven calling turning pro.

Our job, as souls on this mortal journey, is to shift the seat of our identity from the lower realm to the supper, from the ego to the Self.

When you and I struggle against Resistance (or seek to love or endure or give or sacrifice), we are engaged in a contest not only on the material, mental, and emotional planes, but not the spiritual as well.

The struggle is no only to write our symphony or to raise our child or to lead our Special Forces team against the Taliban in Konar province. The clash is epic and internal, between the ego and the Self, and the stakes are our lives.

## Who Is All This For?

In the end, the enterprise and the sacrifice are all about the audience.

They’re about the readers, the moviegoers, the site visitors, the listeners, the concertgoers, the gamers, the gallery-goers — a group which, by the way, includes you and me.

We’re the audience.

In the hero’s journey, the wanderer returns home after years of exile, struggle and suffering. He brings a gift for the people.

That gift arises from what the hero has seen, what he has endure, what he has learned. But the gift is not that raw material alone. it is the ore refined into gold by the hero/wanderer/artists’s skilled and loving hands.

## You are [I am] the artist.

[He] will gladly shell out $24.95 or $9.99 or 99 cents on iTunes to read or see or listen to the 24-karat treasure that you have refined from your pain and your vision and your imagination. I need it. We all do. We’re struggling here in the trenches.

That beauty, that wisdom, those thrills and chills, even that mindless escape on a rainy October after-noon. [He wants it]. Put me down for it.

The hero wanders. the hero suffers. The hero returns.

You are [I am] that hero.
