Working in London I often walk past people sleeping rough. Sometimes I give them money, and sometimes I don't.

Should we give money to homeless people? (It's [not](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/should-we-give-homeless-money-a8124951.html) [straightforward](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/17/should-give-homeless-people-money-gloucester-council-ad).

When I worked at Chordiant (now [Pega](https://www.pega.com/) in 2000 for a while I was up in Glasgow. Flights were from City Airport and the cab driver used to cut through Cable Street. I remember reading an obituary of [Bill Fishman](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/11480782/Professor-Bill-Fishman-East-End-historian-obituary.html) who took part in the Battle of Cable Street. I paid attention because of Cable Street, and because he grew up in th East End like my mum and Nana. (They didn't know each other.)

Obituaries provide a fascinating biographical insight into the person and a celebration of their life's work. They also remind us of our own mortality and ask us to consider the story we're writing with our own lives. Seneca reminds us that [Life is Long, If You Know How To Use It](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/09/01/seneca-on-the-shortness-of-life/).

I noticed this section:

> Recalling that his grandfather, a rabbi, never passed a beggar without giving a donation, he said: “I asked him once what if the man was a scrounger or a drug addict? My grandfather said: 'Let that always be on his conscience, never yours.’ ”

Interesting perspective.

When I ran the London Marathon in 2010 and 2011 the first time I ran for [Sentebale](http://sentebale.org/who-we-are/), having visited Lesotho in 2009 and seen the problems the country has with AIDS and HIV. In the process of raising sponsorship I had an exchange with a colleague who declined to sponsor me because he felt that not enough would go to the people it's designed to help. This seemed to be an objection to charities in general, and not specifically aimed at Sentebale ([2016/17 report accounts](http://3nci582v3ztm44c7lq3ruz2z.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/LR-2016_17-SB-Report-and-Accounts_complete.pdf).

A friend asked me why I chose to support Sentebale when there were many causes closer to home. Fair point. The second year I split the money between Sentebale and a local charity that supported young homeless adults.

We tend to support causes that are [in front of us](https://seths.blog/2014/12/cutting-through-singers-paradox/).


So should we give money directly to a homeless person on the street, because we're cutting out the overhead? How much? Something is infinitely better than nothing. And assuming we don't have unlimited funds, should we prioritise? And if we were to prioritise, do we have enough information to make an informed decision?

Some people get into difficulty through circumstances beyond their control, or lack of education. Or can [no longer afford their rising rent](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/may/23/homeless-teachers-ashamed-housing-crisis-professionals). When I was younger I used to believe that you make your own luck. The Stoic philosophers like Seneca teach us to remember that there are things we can control and things we can't. (Read the [Daily Stoic](https://www.amazon.com/Daily-Stoic-Meditations-Wisdom-Perseverance/dp/0735211736/) for an introduction.)

Where the state fails to look after its people, charities and social entrepreneurs step in.

So if you're not comfortable giving money to someone on the street what else can you do?
