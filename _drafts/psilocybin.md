title:  "Psilocybin as a Treatment for Depression"
---

Last night I attended an event organised by the psychadelic society, focused on the potential to use psilocybin for the treatment of depression.

The event coincides with the launch of a compaign to reschedule psilocybin, which would make research less difficult and allow doctors to prescribe it.

I lost my dad to suicide when I was young, and I expect most of us know someone who has a friend or family member who has experienced depression. Suicide is the biggest killer of [men](https://www.samaritans.org/about-us/our-research/research-report-men-suicide-and-society) [under 50](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/13/suicide-middle-aged-young-people-death), and we have some [challenges](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/oct/24/crisis-in-mental-health-care-for-young-people) maintaining good menatl health for our children. Current treatment involving SSRI's may be relatively cheap at 71p per month, but its effectiveness varies.

If psilocybin has the potential to add to the range of treatments, it makes sense to reschedule it for further investigation.
